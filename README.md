# Pattern Library

> A collection of reusable UI components.

The purpose of this project is to enhance the client-side development process by providing a core base of reusable code (components).

This project is based on [pattern-lib](https://bit.ly/2P8F5ZI). [Components](https://bit.ly/2wqmOiO) have been rewritten in [ReactJS](https://bit.ly/2B7E1yR).

## Usage

To use a component in your project import it as a named module.

```js
import {Accordion} from 'pattern-lib-react';
```
